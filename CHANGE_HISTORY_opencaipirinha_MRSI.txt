Version 0.1 created on March, 1, 2013 based opengrappa_MRSI_1_3.m function and Caipirinha_VisualizingWeightsComputation_And_Application_1_1.m. 




CHANGED IN VERSION 0.2:

- (March 01 2013):	When applying the weights, compute the x,y-components of the  target points directly, 
				without the intermediate step of finding the linear index first (and then computing the x,y-components).

- (March 01 2013):	kernel are now logicals.

- (March 01 2013):	Fixed bug: SourcePattern was not logical, thus logical indexing was not possible.




CHANGED IN VERSION 0.3:

- (March 04 2013):	Increased speed of applying weights by an factor 10 (from ~800 seconds to ~93 seconds).
				The SourcePoints are now no longer computed using logical indexing, but using the relative position information between source and target points and then
				looping over all source points. In the first case, for each (spatial) target point a logical array the same size as the InData array had to be computed.
				Can the loop be vectorized without logical indexing?



CHANGED IN VERSION 1.0:

- (March 04 2013):	Increased speed of computing weights by not picking the weights in a loop, but computing the indices of the source and target weights, and picking them with a linear index.

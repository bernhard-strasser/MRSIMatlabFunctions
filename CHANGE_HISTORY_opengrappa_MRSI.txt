Version 1.0 created on October 24, 2012 based on Alins opengrappa_time.m function. 




CHANGED IN VERSION 1.0:

- (October 24 2012):	Renamed af to R.

- (October 24 2012):	Input data should now be data not with skipped k-points, but set to zero.



CHANGED IN VERSION 1.1:

- (October 29 2012):	Input data should now again be with skipped k-points, NOT set to zero. The reason for this is, if reconstructions in two dimensions are performed,
				the zeros are wrong.


CHANGED IN VERSION 1.2:

- (Jannuary 07 2013):	Interchanged x and y, so that x is the first and y the second spatial index in arrays (e.g. CSI(cha,x,y,slc,time) instead of CSI(cha,y,x,slc,time) as it was before)

- (Jannuary 07 2013):	Instead of string-variable "type", which is either 'row' or 'col', use now variable "ApplyAlongDim", which you can set to 2 or 3.

- (Jannuary 07 2013):	Renamed variables: recon --> OutData, acs --> ACS, sig --> InData, ws --> weights, nc --> nChannel, ns --> nSlice, srcx --> kernelsize_x, sigrecon --> Reco_dummy

- (Jannuary 07 2013):	Added Preparation part with standard value assignments.

- (Jannuary 08 2013):	Improved computational speed by vectorizing time points loop when applying the weights.




CHANGED IN VERSION 1.3:

- (February 04 2013):	a
